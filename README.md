# Dwarf Chef

This is a pet project. I am teaching myself the game development lifecycle, while building experience.

In this game, you play as a Dwarf living in a "Mines of Moria" style mountain city. You own a pub, and must feed customers to earn money with which to pay your rent.
Experimenting with different tools and ingredients is the main focus/game loop. Possibility to add Rogue-like "Ingredient Runs" in future, but not planned for the MVP.
